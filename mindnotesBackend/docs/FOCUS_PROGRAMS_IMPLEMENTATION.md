# Focus Programs Feature - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary

The Focus Programs feature has been fully implemented! This is the main premium feature of MindNotes that allows users to:
- Enroll in structured focus programs (14-day free, 30-day pro)
- Complete daily tasks and focus sessions
- Track progress with streaks and statistics
- Add reflections and weekly reviews
- Manage subscription-based access

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Models

#### PostgreSQL Models ([focus/models.py](mindnotesBackend/focus/models.py))
- `FocusProgram` - Program templates
- `ProgramDay` - Daily content and structure
- `UserFocusProgram` - User enrollment tracking

#### MongoDB Models ([focus/mongo_models.py](mindnotesBackend/focus/mongo_models.py))
- `FocusSessionMongo` - Real-time focus sessions
- `UserProgramDayMongo` - Daily progress tracking
- `ProgramProgressMongo` - Aggregated progress and statistics

### 2. Business Logic

**FocusService** ([core/services.py](mindnotesBackend/core/services.py))
Comprehensive service layer with methods:
- `get_available_programs()` - List programs with enrollment status
- `enroll_in_program()` - Enroll with subscription validation
- `start_program()` - Begin enrolled program
- `get_program_details()` - Full program info with progress
- `get_day_details()` - Specific day info with user progress
- `update_task_status()` - Mark tasks complete/incomplete
- `start_focus_session()` - Begin focus timer
- `complete_focus_session()` - End session and update progress
- `add_reflection()` - Add daily reflections
- `get_weekly_review()` - Weekly summary stats
- `get_program_history()` - All user enrollments

### 3. Permissions

**Premium Access Control** ([core/permissions.py](mindnotesBackend/core/permissions.py))
- `IsPremiumUser` - Validates active Pro subscription
- `IsPremiumUserOrReadOnly` - Read access for all, write for Pro users

### 4. API Layer

**Serializers** ([api/v1/focus/serializers.py](mindnotesBackend/api/v1/focus/serializers.py))
- 15+ serializers for all operations
- Input validation
- Response formatting

**Views** ([api/v1/focus/views.py](mindnotesBackend/api/v1/focus/views.py))
- 15 API endpoints covering complete user flow
- Error handling
- Caching for performance

**URLs** ([api/v1/focus/urls.py](mindnotesBackend/api/v1/focus/urls.py))
- RESTful routing
- Already integrated in main URLs

### 5. Data Seeding

**Management Command** ([focus/management/commands/seed_focus_programs.py](mindnotesBackend/focus/management/commands/seed_focus_programs.py))
- Seeds 14-day program (Free)
- Seeds 30-day program (Pro)
- Creates all 44 program days with content

## Quick Start

### 1. Server is already running? Great!

If not, start the server:
```bash
cd mindnotesBackend
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Test API Access

The programs are already seeded! Test with:

```bash
# Get authentication token (use your existing user or create one)
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# List available programs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/programs/

# This should show:
# - 14-Day Focus Challenge (free access)
# - 30-Day Focus Mastery (requires Pro)
```

### 3. Complete User Flow Example

```bash
# 1. Enroll in 14-day program
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/programs/enroll/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"program_id":1}'

# 2. Start the program
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/programs/start/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enrollment_id":1}'

# 3. Get Day 1 details
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/programs/1/days/1/

# 4. Start focus session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/sessions/start/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enrollment_id":1,
    "day_number":1,
    "duration_minutes":25,
    "session_type":"program"
  }'

# 5. Complete the session (use session_id from previous response)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/focus/sessions/complete/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id":"your_session_id_here",
    "productivity_rating":4,
    "notes":"Great first session!"
  }'
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Hybrid Database Strategy
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data (programs, days, enrollments)
- **MongoDB**: Time-series data (sessions, progress, reflections)
- **Benefit**: Optimal performance for both structured and flexible data

### Service Layer Pattern
- All business logic in `FocusService`
- Views are thin controllers
- Easy to test and maintain

### Permission-Based Access Control
- Automatic subscription validation
- Clear error messages for users
- Scalable for future tiers

### Caching Strategy
- Program list cached per user (10 min)
- Reduces database load
- Easy to invalidate on enrollment

## Integration with Wireframe

Based on your wireframe ([https://wireframe-topaz.vercel.app/](https://wireframe-topaz.vercel.app/)):

### âœ… Programs Tab
- Shows available programs (14-day, 30-day)
- Displays lock icon for Pro programs
- Shows enrollment status and progress

### âœ… Daily Flow
- 3 tasks per day (configurable)
- Focus timer with presets (25min, 50min, custom)
- Reflection prompts

### âœ… Focus Timer
- Start/pause/resume functionality
- Distraction logging
- Motivational quotes (can be added to UI)
- Session history

### âœ… Weekly Review
- Days completed
- Total focus time
- Completion rate
- Streak tracking
- Achievements

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

### 1. Authentication
Set up JWT token management in your frontend.

### 2. State Management
Consider using Redux/Context for:
- Active program state
- Current session state
- User subscription status

### 3. Real-time Timer
Frontend timer countdown using:
```javascript
// Get active session
const session = await api.get('/focus/sessions/active/')

// If session exists, show countdown
if (session.active_session) {
  // Calculate remaining time
  const elapsed = Date.now() - new Date(session.active_session.started_at)
  const remaining = session.active_session.planned_duration_seconds * 1000 - elapsed
  // Start countdown
}
```

### 4. Subscription Check
Before enrolling in 30-day program:
```javascript
// Check if user has Pro
const programs = await api.get('/focus/programs/')
const proProgram = programs.find(p => p.is_pro_only)

if (!proProgram.can_access) {
  // Show upgrade modal
  showUpgradeModal()
}
```

### 5. Progress Visualization
Use the progress data for:
- Progress bars
- Streak flames ðŸ”¥
- Completion circles
- Calendar view with colored days

## Testing Checklist

## Documentation

Full API documentation available at:
`mindnotesBackend/docs/FOCUS_PROGRAMS_API.md`

Includes:
- All 15 endpoints with examples
- Request/response formats
- Error handling
- Database models reference
- Complete user flow examples
- Testing commands

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Django logs**: Look for errors in console
2. **Check MongoDB connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running
3. **Check migrations**: Run `python manage.py migrate`
4. **Check seeded data**: Run `python manage.py seed_focus_programs` again

## Performance Notes

- **Optimized queries**: Using `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
- **Indexes**: MongoDB collections have compound indexes
- **Caching**: Program lists cached per user
- **Scalability**: Service layer makes it easy to add background tasks

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **WebSocket support** for real-time timer sync across devices
2. **Push notifications** for session reminders
3. **Social features** (share progress, compete with friends)
4. **Custom programs** (user-created programs)
5. **AI insights** based on focus patterns
6. **Calendar integration** (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar)
7. **Export reports** (PDF, CSV)
8. **More achievements/badges**
